* Test with the simulator for several hours
  Test with only some components enabled
  Test with only some addons enabled
  Test with different values of critical configuration options
  Test in different time zones:
  - non-DST (Australia/Perth)
  - UTC
  - DST (full hours) (Europe/Paris)
    - with a non-DST time
    - with a DST time
  - DST (non-full hours) (Australia/Adelaide)
