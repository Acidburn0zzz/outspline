### BEST PRACTICES ###
- Component versioning follows http://semver.org/
  Addon versioning merges the MINOR and PATCH numbers
- Make sure that every database table is managed by one and only one extension
- Major addon version number should be increased when breaking backward
  compatibility
- Import optional dependency APIs with the appropriate function
- Don't rely on automatic database maintenance procedures when the database or
  the entire program is closed, in fact in case of a crash, since the procedure
  hasn't been started yet, the database could get damaged or anyway be left in
  an unpredicted state
- Make sure that all the commands that can be launched either directly by the
  user (through interaction with the interfaces and their plugins) or
  automatically (e.g. by a timer) are protected by the Protection class methods
